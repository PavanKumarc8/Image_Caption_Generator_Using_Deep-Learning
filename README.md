# Image_Caption_Generator_Using_Deep-Learning
This repository contains an image caption generator implemented using deep learning techniques. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate descriptive captions based on the extracted features.
